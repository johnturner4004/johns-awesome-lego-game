# John's Awesome Lego Game

## Description

So while as I am continuing to learn various programming languages, I decided that I want to have something fun to learn also. I love video games and always thought it'd be cool to learn how to make one. This is my first attempt at making a game. If you've worked through Unity Engine's tutorials you will probable recognize this simple Lego game. There was no code that I had to write for it since I used all prefabricated game elements. This was more to learn how to work in their IDE. Still, it's my first game so I wanted to show it off.

### Prerequisites

The .app file should run on a Mac. To use the code you will need to download [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/). At the time this was written, the download is located in the developer tools tab.

## Installation

To just install the game itself, just download the .app file and double click it to open it.

To make your own version of the game, open the project in Unity. Make any desired changes to the game and save the project(<kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>). Make sure you save BEFORE you build the game. It will revert to your last save when you run the build. To build the game, select build and run from the file menu or press <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd>.

## Usage

1. The game will start with the player standing on a large rocklike floating island. 
2. To adjust the view simple move the mouse.
3. To move the player, use the <kbd>w</kbd>,<kbd>a</kbd>,<kbd>s</kbd>, and <kbd>d</kbd> keys.
4. to jump press the <kbd>space</kbd> key.
5. The game features some floating green gems.
6. To win the game, collect all the gems.
